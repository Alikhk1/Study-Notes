# Visualizing Stories

## Diagrams/Charts

### 1. Pie Chart
- Distribution of Quantitative data
- Poor job of comparing values with similar amounts

### 2. Bar Chart
- Effectively show counts and frequencies
- Communicates same information better than pie chart

### 3. Scatter Plot
- Plots relationship between 2 quantitative variables

### 4. Line Chart
- Time Series data
- Compare elements over time

### 5. Area Charts
- Like line, but fill the area beneath the line

## Credibility in Visualizations

1. **Consistency**: Thought, Colors, Design
2. **Reputation**: Introduce your professional background, Cite information from sources

## Design Principles

- **Eliminate Clutter & Focus Attention on Visuals**
  - Don't sensory overload
  - Improve your visuals in increments
  - Size, Hue and Position signal relative importance

- **Data Density**: Ratio of Information display to how much space it occupies, Ideal is 50%-60%

- **Color Usage**:
  - Never color causally
  - If something is not black, white or grey, there must be a reason
  - Orange/Blue are color blind friendly
