# Data Culture & Maturity

## Data Culture
An organizational environment where data is consistently trusted, shared, and used to drive decision-making.

**Data Culture** = shared values, behaviors, and practices around using data for decisions. It's not just tools, it's mindset.

## Maturity Models
Maturity models are frameworks that assess the development stage of a process, capability, or organization.
