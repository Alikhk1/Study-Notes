# Study Notes

This repository contains my personal learning notes across different areas including Python, SQL, Machine Learning, Data Literacy, Docker, and more.  

I wanted to share them openly so they might help or be useful to someone else who is learning these topics.  

---

## Structure
- **python/** – core programming notes  
- **sql/** – relational databases and queries  
- **machine-learning/** – ML concepts and algorithms  
- **data-literacy/** – data fundamentals and ethics  
- **devops/** – Docker, containers, shell basics  

Each folder includes `README.md` files for easy browsing.

## Future Updates
I plan to continue adding new notes and refining existing ones as I learn more.
